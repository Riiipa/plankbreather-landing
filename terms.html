        <h1>Terms of Use for Plank Breather</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to Plank Breather. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Plank Breather mobile application (the "App"), provided by <strong>Dmytro Ripa</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Plank Breather is a health and fitness application designed to transform the plank exercise into a mindful practice. The App provides tools such as a timer, a guided breathing program, progress tracking, and gamification features to help users build a consistent and healthy habit. The App operates on a freemium model, with basic features available for free and advanced features available through in-app purchases ("Plank Breather Pro").</p>

        <h2>2. Health & Medical Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Your health is your responsibility. The App is not a substitute for professional medical advice.</p>

            <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or experienced in the App. Stop exercising immediately if you experience faintness, dizziness, pain, or shortness of breath. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that you are doing so at your own risk.</li>
        </ul>
