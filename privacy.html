        <h1>Privacy Policy for Plank Breather</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 14, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Plank Breather. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you, how we use it, and how we protect it. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Plank Breather is designed to be a private and personal tool. We collect very limited information, which can be categorized as follows:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Data You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Name and Profile Photo:</strong> You have the option to set a user name and a profile photo within the app. This information is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Anonymous Analytics Data</h3>
        <p>To improve the app and understand how it is used, we collect anonymous, non-personal analytics data using Google's Firebase Analytics service. This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. The information we collect includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generic usage events, such as when a session is completed or a feature (like the Breath Program) is used.</li>
            <li>Information about app crashes and performance issues.</li>
            <li>General, non-specific device information (e.g., device type, OS version).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do **not** collect your IP address, precise location, or any other personal identifiers through our analytics.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To understand which features are most popular and to improve the overall user experience.</li>
            <li>To identify and fix bugs or performance issues.</li>
            <li>To make informed decisions about future app development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. The anonymous analytics data is processed by Google Firebase, which has its own strict privacy policy. You can learn more about <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All your personal training data (sessions, achievements, settings) is stored locally on your device in its secure storage. We do not have access to this data. The anonymous analytics data is stored on Google's secure servers.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:plankbreather@gmail.com">plankbreather@gmail.com</a></p>
