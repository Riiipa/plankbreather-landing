        <h1>Privacy Policy for Plank Breather</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 14, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Plank Breather. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it. Your privacy is our top priority.</p>

        <h2>Our Privacy-First Approach</h2>
        <p>Plank Breather is designed with a "privacy by design" philosophy. We believe that your personal training data belongs to you and you alone.</p>
        
        <h3>Workout Data (Session History)</h3>
        <p><strong>All your workout data (including dates, durations, and achievements) is stored exclusively on your device.</strong> We, the developers, do not have access to this information, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third party. This ensures the complete privacy of your training history.</p>

        <h3>Voluntary Data</h3>
        <p>You have the option to set a user name and a profile photo within the app. This information is also stored only on your device.</p>

        <h2>Anonymous Analytics to Improve the App</h2>
        <p>To understand how the app is used and to make it better, we collect anonymous, non-personal analytics data using Google's Firebase Analytics service. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally. We collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generic usage events, such as when a feature is used or the Pro screen is viewed.</li>
            <li>Information about app crashes for bug fixing.</li>
            <li>General, non-specific device information (e.g., device type, OS version).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your IP address, precise location, or any personal identifiers through our analytics.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
        <p>We respect your privacy rights. As all your personal and workout data is stored locally on your device, you have full control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access and Rectify:</strong> You can access and edit your user name at any time within the app's statistics screen. You can view your complete workout history in the app's calendar and charts.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):</strong> To permanently delete all your app-related data, simply delete the Plank Breather app from your device. This will remove all locally stored information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your personal workout data remains on your device for as long as you have the app installed. The anonymous analytics data we collect is automatically deleted from Firebase servers after a standard retention period of 14 months.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. The anonymous analytics data is processed by Google Firebase, which has its own strict privacy policy. You can learn more about <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
